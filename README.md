# Super Smash SNES

https://team-no-sleep.github.io/super-smash-snes/

Welcome to our heavily influenced fighting game of the 16-bit era! We will be drawing from many genres from games like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Killer Instinct, and more! It will have eveything Super Nintendo! Our integration of Earth Worm Jim, Simba, and Battle Toads aren't excluded from this endeavor!

**We currently have the following feature LIVE!:**

- Online real time 2 player battle hosted with Firebase
- Keyboard assignments with fully animated sprites
- Collision detection and hit boxes
- QA objects for testing and loggin
- Character attribute object for bootstrapping new characters
- A (soon) to be published method of creating and coding sprites. It's currently in our Trello board.
- Live trash talking with google accounts
- Music and sound effects

**Our future plans in progress:**

- Frame rate test object
- CSS steps with time intervals for the first 1 to 2 frames on holding keydown to encourage feints
- Ducking and smaller hit boxes to make missing attacks a greater factor
- Simulated 2D gravity
- Absurd and silly finishing moves such as kicking your opponent with a giant Godzilla foot, drunk Bahamut crash landing on your face, and   my personal favorite: crushing your opponent with Bobble Wobble bobbles!
- More selectable characters
- An old school 16-bit opening scene
- A Toasty easter egg
- Team fights
- Team fights inside a gravity chamber stage where keypad controls become random, gravity gets squirrely, and bouncy boundaries; all in     random intervals
- "INSERT COIN" easter eggs
- Zombie mode easter egg when your opponent leaves in the middle of a match, it becomes a green sprite cpu version that tries to eat         you. This might be a cool AI experiment to replcate your opponents fight style.
- Mortal Kombat uppercuts to launch you onto another fight stage
- Character celebrations
- Giant character dialogue pictures with hilariously unwitty broken English
- Oh yeah, wall boundaries so that sprites can't nope out of a fight
- Punching opponents into the air for some aerial wall bouncing battles
- Missingo, I know it's not SNES, but Super Game Boy counts
- If it gets bloated, and I suspect it will, loading screens with Mario Paint, Dr. Mario, and and Mario Composer
- A character with purposely buggy animations
- Joystick integration
- Mini side scroller quests ala The Simpsons, Ninja Turtle in Time, and Beavis and Butthead
- We'll eventually want server side hosting for all these sprites we're pumping out
