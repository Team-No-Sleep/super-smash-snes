# Smash-SNES

## Part 1- our MVP:

#### Idea: To build an online street fight game with our favorite comic characters while chatting live with other players.

#### Target Audience: More popular among the older generation who enjoy street fights but also attracts the younger generation for its live features such as chatting and exciting theme song.

#### Problem: We try to implement as many APIs and features into our product to meet class requirements but at the same time expand our creativity to recreate one of our favorite games."

#### Goal: Our goal is to provide a secure and easy to use online game platform that is suitable for our target users.

### User Stories:
  1. As a user, I want to be able to log in easily via Google.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to play as our favorite comic icons while chatting.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to connect with players via our chatboard.
