# Smash-SNES


### Part 1- our MVP:



#### Idea: To build an online street fight game with our favorite comic characters while chatting live with other players.

#### Target Audience: More popular among the older generation who enjoy street fights but also atracts younger generation for its live features such as chatting, emojis and exciting theme songs.

#### Problem: We try to implement as many APIs and features into our product to meet class requirements but at the same time not to expand our creativity."

#### Goal: Our goal is to provide a secure and easy to use online game platform that is suitable with our target users.

### User Stories:

  1. As a user, I want to be able to log in easily via Google.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to play as our favourite comic icons while chatting.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to connect with players via our chatboard.
